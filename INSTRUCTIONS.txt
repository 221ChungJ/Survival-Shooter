Hello and welcome to my game. It doesn't have a name yet, so feel free to come up with one!

The soldier with the gun is the main character. Control him using the arrow keys (left and right) and use the space bar to shoot.
You're only allowed to fire your gun while standing still, not while running. 
Zombies will spawn on different sides of the screen. 
Each zombie is worth one point.
Try to accumulate as many points as possible by shooting the zombies before getting killed. 
Press the esc key to restart the level once you die. 
There are barriers on either end of the level so you can't run forever!
